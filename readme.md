##How to play/open the project

1. Have Node installed
2. Clone the project
3. Run `npm install`
4. Once that is finished run `npm start`. This will automatically open a window in your browser (or look at the console output if it doesn't and there will be a URL  the default address is `http://localhost:8080`)
